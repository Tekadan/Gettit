# Gettit: An Angular 2 App that consumes the Reddit API

The goal of this project is to create an application that:
 - Allows the user to get the latest posts from the reddit front page with some basic meta data about each post
 - Allows the user to refresh the results
 - Have dynamic links based on the results that will direct the user to the actual reddit post if they wish to do so
